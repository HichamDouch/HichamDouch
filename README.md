# 💫 About Me:
As a frontend developer, I have a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and am proficient in a variety of modern frameworks and libraries such as Vue.js, Vuex, and TailwindCSS. I have experience using responsive design techniques and have a good eye for aesthetics, which I've utilized in projects using Bootstrap and Vuetify. I'm also familiar with Pinia and Cypress for building performant and reliable web applications.
